-- Hollywood Highest Grossing Movie Analysis --
In this project, I want to find out about Netflix shows in terms of their revenue, ratings, budget, etc. 
I want to find out whether there are any relationships between top-grossing shows with budgets or any other variables.

2) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-movie-franchise-revenue-and-budget-data
3) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajugc/imdb-top-250-movies-dataset
4) Manual searching for some missing values (e.g.: Missing budget values, etc).
