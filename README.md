# SQLProjects
Hi, everyone! Welcome to my GitHub page. This repository is where I store all of my personal SQL & data analytics projects. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or to give feedback.

I also visualise data in PowerBI and you can take a look at it on my Medium page <a href="https://medium.com/@agatha.limonso1">here</a>.

Thank you for visiting. Connect with me on LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/agathalimonso/">here</a>!
